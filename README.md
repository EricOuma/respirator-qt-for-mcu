# Overview
Hospitals worldwide are in desperate need of more ventilators that help patients breathe. Factories and companies are now trying to pick-up production. Nissan, Renault, Ford, General Motors and Tesla amongst  other have volunteered. The Society of Critical Medicine says 960.000 patients in the U.S. alone may need ventilators but only 200.000 are available.

We have built a proof-of-concept of the user interface for a ventilator based on Qt for MCUs technology running on a microcontroller platform. We are releasing the prototype source code for free to all ventilator manufacturers. 

# Qt For MCU

Selecting the Qt for MCUs technology worked well and we were able to complete the work in record time. These were some of the things that made us work on Qt: 
* Reduced cost per unit as it runs on microcontroller platforms. 
* Easy to adapt to different screens sizes & ratios. 
* Fully functional touch UI. 
* Reduced software development cost by reusing of existing UI assets and logic. 
* Instant boot time with low memory consumption.
